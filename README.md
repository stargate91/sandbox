# Python Sandbox Projects

This repository contains a growing collection of small Python scripts and mini-projects created while learning Python. The focus is on **hands-on practice**, experimenting with real data, and improving problem-solving skills.

Each folder in this repo is **self-contained** and includes a script (or scripts) that accomplish a small task from basic file manipulation and data analysis to visualizations with matplotlib and seaborn.

---

## Project Structure

Each subfolder typically contains:
- `main.py` or a descriptive `.py` file
- input/output files (if needed)
- an optional `README.md` for larger tasks

Output files (like `.csv`, `.png`) are usually ignored in version control.

## Completed Sandbox Tasks

| #   | Folder Name                    | Description                                            |
|-----|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 01  | `01_mass_file_creator/`        | Creates 100 empty `.txt` files in a directory.         |
| 02  | `02_file_renamer/`             | Adds a `backup_` prefix to existing `.txt` files.      |
| 03  | `03_log_error_counter/`        | Counts how many lines contain "ERROR" in `log.txt`.    |
| 04  | `04_csv_score_checker/`        | Reads a CSV file and prints scores above a threshold.  |
| 05  | `05_numpy_basics/`             | Performs simple NumPy array operations and reshaping.  |
| 06  | `06_numpy_statistics/`         | Generates random numbers, then computes mean, median, std. |
| 07  | `07_numpy_linear_algebra/`     | Demonstrates matrix multiplication, determinant, inverse, and eigenvalues. |
| 08  | `08_pandas_basics/`            | Basic Pandas filtering, sorting, grouping, and saving CSV. |
| 09  | `09_plotting_basics/`          | Simple line plot using matplotlib.                     |
| 10  | `10_seaborn_barplot/`          | Horizontal barplot comparing GDP values by country.    |
| 11  | `11_histogram_comparison/`     | Comparison of histograms using matplotlib and seaborn. |

## Future Additions

Planned tasks and ideas:
- SQL and SQLite practice
- Data pipelines (cleaning + visualizing)
- REST APIs with Flask or FastAPI
- ML mini-projects (Scikit-learn)
- Web scraping

---

## Notes

- Most scripts are standalone `.py` files (no frameworks or heavy setup required).
- Designed for learning and demonstration, not for production use.
- File paths are mostly relative and OS-independent using `os.path`.
